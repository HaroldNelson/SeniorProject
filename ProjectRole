Joshua Schulz

My role in this project was the main software engineer. I created the website which hosted Dr. Chen's Parallel Programming course.
I also created the content for the course itself which required me to create massive documents of research that I put together to learn all the subjects that will be in this class.
The majority of the work that I put into this project went towards formatting the information into the webpages that looked good and was informative.
