Progress Report 2







2.16.2020






1. What have you done personally in the two weeks leading up to today?

In the last two weeks, I have developed the content that will be used in the first week of the parallel programming course which will basically introduce the class to the topics that will be covered. I have also started developing the content for the start of the first chapter of content, which will be on C programming.


2. Describe any significant progress made by the team as a whole in this time period.

Like I said, I have been hard at work creating content for the website. Sanju has been busy with the network side of things and also took lead on the poster that is due this week (Which looks great).
