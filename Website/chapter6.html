			<h2>  Chapter 6 - OpenMP Directives </h2></font>
			<center><p>
<p>Compiler directives appear as comments in your source code and are ignored by compilers unless you tell them otherwise - usually by specifying the appropriate compiler flag, as discussed in the Compiling section later. 
<p>OpenMP compiler directives are used for various purposes: 
	Spawning a parallel region 
	Dividing blocks of code among threads 
	Distributing loop iterations between threads 
	Serializing sections of code 
	Synchronization of work among threads 
<p>Compiler directives have the following syntax: 
sentinel       directive-name      [clause, ...]
For example (C/C++):
#pragma omp parallel default(shared) private(beta,pi)

<p>The parallel directive
This directive defines a parallel region, which is code that will be executed by multiple threads in parallel. The following is an example of the parallel directive in C++:
// omp_parallel.cpp
// compile with: /openmp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

<p>int main() {
   #pragma omp parallel num_threads(4)
   {
      int i = omp_get_thread_num();
      printf_s("Hello from thread %d\n", i);
   }
}
<p>This is the output from the code above:
<p>Hello from thread 0
<p>Hello from thread 1
<p>Hello from thread 2
<p>Hello from thread 3

<p>For Directive
<p>This directive causes the work done in a for loop inside a parallel region to be divided among threads. This is what the directive might look like in C++:
#pragma omp [parallel] for [clauses]
   for_statement
<p>If parallel is also specified, clauses can be any clause accepted by the parallel or for directives, except nowait.

<p><p>Sections Directive
<p>This directive identifies code sections to be divided among all threads. For example, this directive in C++ might look like this:
// omp_sections.cpp
// compile with: /openmp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

int main() {
    #pragma omp parallel sections num_threads(4)
    {
        printf_s("Hello from thread %d\n", omp_get_thread_num());
        #pragma omp section
        printf_s("Hello from thread %d\n", omp_get_thread_num());
    }
}
<p><p>The output for the code above would be the following:
<p>Hello from thread 0
<p>Hello from thread 0

<p>Parallel For Directive
<p>This directive is a combination of the parallel directive and the for directive. Below is example code, demonstrating this directive:
 #include <omp.h>
 #define N       1000
 #define CHUNKSIZE   100

 main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

 int i, chunk;
 float a[N], b[N], c[N];

 /* Some initializations */
 for (i=0; i < N; i++)
   a[i] = b[i] = i * 1.0;
 chunk = CHUNKSIZE;

 #pragma omp parallel for \
   shared(a,b,c,chunk) private(i) \
   schedule(static,chunk)
   for (i=0; i < N; i++)
     c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
 }

<p>Parallel Sections Directive
<p>The parallel sections directive provides a shortcut form for specifying a parallel region that has only a single sections directive. The semantics are the same as explicitly specifying a parallel directive immediately followed by a sections directive. The syntax of the parallel sections directive is as follows:
#pragma omp parallel sections  [clause[[,] clause] ...] new-line
   {
   [#pragma omp section new-line]
      structured-block
   [#pragma omp section new-linestructured-block  ]
   ...
}


<p><p>Environment Variables: 
<p>OpenMP provides several environment variables for controlling the execution of parallel code at run-time. These environment variables can be used to control such things as: 
	Setting the number of threads 
	Specifying how loop iterations are divided 
	Binding threads to processors 
	Enabling/disabling nested parallelism; setting the maximum levels of nested parallelism 
	Enabling/disabling dynamic threads 
	Setting thread stack size 
	Setting thread wait policy 
<p>Setting OpenMP environment variables is done the same way you set any other environment variables and depends upon which shell you use. For example: 
csh/tcsh
setenv OMP_NUM_THREADS 8
sh/bash
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=8

<p>Below is an example of OpenMP code structure in (C/C++):
#include <omp.h>
   main ()  {
   int var1, var2, var3;
   Serial code 
         .
         .
         .
   Beginning of parallel region. Fork a team of threads.
   Specify variable scoping 
   #pragma omp parallel private(var1, var2) shared(var3)
      {
      Parallel region executed by all threads 
                 .
      Other OpenMP directives
                 .
      Run-time Library calls
                 .
      All threads join master thread and disband 
      }  
   Resume serial code 
         .
         .
         .
   }


<p>C/C++ Directives Format
 
<p>Example: #pragma omp parallel default(shared) private(beta,pi)

<p>These are the general rules:
<p>Case sensitive 
<p>Directives follow conventions of the C/C++ standards for compiler directives 
<p>Only one directive-name may be specified per directive 
<p>Each directive applies to at most one succeeding statement, which must be a structured block. 
<p>Long directive lines can be "continued" on succeeding lines by escaping the newline character with a backslash ("\") at the end of a directive line.
