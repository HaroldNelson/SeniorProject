Mid-Term Progress Report

3.6.2020



Alongside this report, I will also upload the website content which we will use to present soon.



Recently, I have finished documenting the content for a semester's worth of parallel programming class. In total, I created a 66 page word document with over 11,300 words.

This content came from a variety of sources, all of which are sited in my work.



Finally, I added all the content onto the websites by inputting it into their respective html files. In total, there are 12 chapters with an introduction and an overview, which concludes the course.



To wrap up the project, over the next few weeks, I will be working with Sanju to test the software and hardware as well as input all the webpages and their materials into the raspberry pi's.
