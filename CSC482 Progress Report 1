1. Briefly describe your project. (About 2 sentences.)
Sanju and I have started this senior project together to build a multi-purpose Raspberry Pi Cluster Webserver to deploy an educaitonal website for client to teach C programming and Parallel Computing with MPI and OpenMP.

2. What is your particular role in the project?
My role is software engineer. I develop the website that is loaded onto the Pi's. I also come up with the content that is to be put on the website for the parallel programming class.

3. What have you done personally in the two weeks leading up to today?
In the last two weeks, I have spent a lot of time researching C programming using a book that Dr. Chen loaned us. I also used internet resources and techniques learned in my classes to help me develop a website that is easily navigatable and looks nice.

4. Describe any significant progress made by the team as a whole in this time period.
Recently, Sanju has completed implementing VPN and VNC and I have completed the format for how each subpage will look when we apply content to them.
