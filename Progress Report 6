Progress Report 6

1. What have you done personally in the two weeks leading up to today?

In the last two weeks, I have done practically nothing regarding the project besides check for bugs/spelling errors a few times. This is because the project has been finished and we need not work on it.

2. Describe any significant progress made by the team as a whole in this time period.

As far as I am aware, we have not done much to the project since we finished it.
