Progress Report 3

10.12.2019



1. What have you done personally in the two weeks leading up to today?

I have for the most part, completed the website for this parallel programming class. 2 days ago, I made the final adjustments as described by Dr. Chen, and submitted them to this repository.
Also, Connor, Sanju, and myself have met a few times to test the bounds of the raspberry pi's.

2. Describe any significant progress made by the team as a whole in this time period.

Our team has maintained a steady pace for completing the first half of this project well before it is due. We have the server cluster set up, the website and subpages ready to be uploaded, and now we must continue to link the pi's together.
