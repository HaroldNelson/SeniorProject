Progress Report 2
9.29.2019

1. What have you done personally in the two weeks leading up to today?
As directed by Dr. Chen, I have read about the language C as well as OpenMP and MPI. Along with that, Sanju, Connor, and I have set a meeting with Dr. Chen to begin the process of setting up the hardware (The Raspberry Pi's and the server). This will happen tomorrow (9.30.2019).
2. Describe any significant progress made by the team as a whole in this time period.
I would say the biggest steps made by our group in this time period is our research on C as well as actually aquiring the hardware.
